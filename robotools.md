# Creative Robot Tool Use With LLMs

## Intuition: 
imbuing robots with the ability to creatively use tools in tasks that involve implicit physical constraints and long-term planning

## What?
RoboTool, a system that accepts natural language instructions and outputs executable code for controlling robots in both simulated
and real-world environments.

## How?
`1. Analyzer: to identify crucial concepts that will affect task plan`
- Part 1 : analysis of thinking process
- Part 2: crucial concpets and their values
- Analysis added to _L_ (original language instruction) for downstream modules -> _L*_

`2. Planner: generates a task skeleton based on L*`

- Part 1: description section
- Part 2: plan section

`3. Calculator: `
`4. Coder: `
